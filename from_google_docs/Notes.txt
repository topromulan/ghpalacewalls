 Notes


 
The lawn is modeled after the part in the King's own hair.
 
Behind the archway, on the back of the wall, huge iron grate is poised to slam down and join the wall sealing out attackers.
 
*Leprechaun weed snipers kneeling by the flower beds. (invisible)
 
 
The walkway is at (1,5,1)
Front Lawn is at (3,1,1)
 
The lawn comber complains about the Prince's cowlick.
Grimhaven Shipping Office is at (6,1,1)
How high are the walls, and what’s the story with Adders front.
 

When you slip a paper through the crack in the east side of the Corner Pocket, Fertuman farlooks you. He will then raise a spell that allows passage into the Logrus Maze. Placement within the maze is random, so groups may be split up as they access the maze one at a time. Fertumann will also teleport you out (to random location upon request).

If Fertumann dies, then the Maze becomes a death zone, the maze collapses and any player bodies on the floor are irrecoverable until Fertumann respawns.


Guards if present should block you from exiting a watchtower onto the roof, crunch style.

No exit to the up, the watchtowers have roofs. 


Where will Grimhaven One perch? Or will he always circle the spires?  On top of the garrison would be a good perch .. possibly make him always circle until airspace is finished over the garrison and then change his behavior.  Someday perhaps he can be flown all the way to Amber hospital in airspace.
