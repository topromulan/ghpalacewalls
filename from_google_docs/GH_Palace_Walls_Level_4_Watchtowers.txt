 GH Palace Walls Level 4 - Watchtowers

(1,6,3)
High above a warrior training yard, level with the watchtowers of Palace Grimhaven, the World unfolds down and out around.
 The top of the city garrison is the most immediately down unfolding view just below and to the north, but other views extend beyond the city walls.
 The Palace's northwest watchtower is just to the southeast from here.
