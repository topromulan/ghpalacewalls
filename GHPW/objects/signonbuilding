ATTENTION:

The Royal Family of Grimhaven (hereafter “The King”) have come to a gentlemanly settlement with the proprietor of Herman Adder's Coffee House (hereafter “Herman”) with regard to blatant zoning violations concerning a large building placed on the Palace Lawn (hereafter “The Lawn”).  Whereby, Herman shall provide, at no reduction in tax, catering service to all sporting events occurring on The Lawn that have been endorsed by The King.
