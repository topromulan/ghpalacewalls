The palace walls data and build scripts.

GHPW is the build stuff from when I had Weed account and scripting the build.

From_google_docs is the room descriptions data exported. Easier to maintain here. Google docs sucks they should have done something like github!

I'm going to stay off the forums due to Pappy deleting my messages basically so glad you found this and get in touch with me by MUDmailing Day or a forums PM should do as well, I would get that fine.

Thanks

Dale
